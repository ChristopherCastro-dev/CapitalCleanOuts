## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Neon green (#1AB16A) for highlighting important interactive elements, drawing inspiration from the user's brand guidelines.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1A1A1A) for a modern, sleek, high-end feel that will work as an appropriate backdrop for neon-green-accented content.
- Accent color: Light-yellow (#DBD374) for calls to action and secondary interactive elements, that still maintains the general green hue but allows more color contrast with the neon primary.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for large headings; its computerized style provides the techy and futuristic feel requested by the user. Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for paragraphs.
- A comprehensive icon pack complementing each service offered (home, garage, storage, etc.) for clear, instant recognition.
- Mobile-first approach utilizing a modern grid layout, ensuring seamless viewing and interaction on any device.
- Smooth, subtle animations and transitions across the site for a high-end and interactive user experience, as per the request.
